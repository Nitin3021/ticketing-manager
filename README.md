# Ticketing manager

## Overview

Welcome to my personal project! This project is built upon the implementation of Microservices using Typescript to facilitate buying & selling Tickets. The term "tickets" refer to a general idea where it could be a movie ticket, concert ticket or it could be even a football/soccer game ticket! Customers can place order and pay using Stripe as a payment method. Once an order has been successfully paid/purchased, it would be visible in the purchase history. 

<ins>Work is still in progress and I would be happy to share more details upon the project completion!</ins>

## Features

- Account signup/login page for customers
- Ticket creation and setting up the price
- Customers can buy those tickets at the stated price
- Custom time out if the order is made but payment is pending
- Order cancellation
- Stripe payment method implementation
- Historical ticket purchase list display
